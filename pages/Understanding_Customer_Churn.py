    - **Each dot** = one customer  
    - **Each row** = one feature used in the model  
    - **X-axis (left ‚Üî right)** = how much the feature influenced the model's churn prediction
        - **Wide spread** = this feature has a **strong impact** (important)
        - **Tight cluster near 0** = this feature has **little impact** (unimportant)
        - **Right** = increases predicted churn  
        - **Left** = decreases predicted churn  
    - **Color** shows the actual value of the feature:
        - üî¥ Red = high value  
        - üîµ Blue = low value  

    ---
    **Example**: If blue dots (short tenure) appear on the right for "tenure", it means short-tenure customers are more likely to churn.
